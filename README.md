# Europe's Population Growth Prediction

This repository contains notebook which includes data analysis, visualization, and forecasting of population of Europe

This notebook is intended to analyze the Europe's population from the year 1960 till 2021. The data source for the world's population is Worldbank.org. Although the downloaded data have population information for the whole world, but we filter out only the European region for our analysis.

After performing the data analysis and visualizations, I trained the SARIMA (Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model to forecast the population uptil year 2050. From the visualizations and analysis, I got to analyze that the population of the European countries have been increasing since 1960 till date.

However, this increase was very sharp until the year 1995, but after 1995, we see an increase but not very sharp one compared to previous years. Moreover, the annual growth percentage has been decreasing since 1960 till date. In this project, the population forecast has been done on overall population of the Europe, but it can also be done on individual countries. The forecast showed us an increase in the Europe's population till 2050. By 2050, the population is expected to reach 760 million, which is around 740 million currently in the year 2021.
